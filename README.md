## What is this?
Databot3000 is my personal data infrastructure; a small data warehousing solution bundled with data ingestion tools, the 'EL' to my ELT so to speak. It basically runs a bunch of Python jobs in a GCP project configured with terraform and kubectl for very long-running workloads and in modal labs for ad-hoc compute.
