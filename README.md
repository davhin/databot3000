## What is this?
Databot3000 is a learning project for me to play around with new data tech, as well as my personal data warehouse for smaller analytics projects. It is aimed at being operated by a single data engineer (Hello!), but should easily be able to service teams of a dozen. Which, incidentally, should be enough for >80% of companies as well. 

The focus is on easy of maintenance, and low costs.

## What is this not?
An enterprise level data solution.
