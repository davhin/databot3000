# Databot3000
[He belongs to the cloud now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HUh9Sg7_eg)

## What is this?
Databot3000 is meant as a learning project for me to play around with new data/ml engineering tech (mostly on GCP), as well as my personal data warehouse for smaller analytics projects. It is aimed at being operated by a single data engineer (Hello!), but should easily be able to service a team of a dozen data analysts/scientists.
The focus is on easy of maintenance, and low costs.

## What is this not?
An enterprise level data solution.
